7.1. Restart the application automatically
The node command has to be re-executed in bash whenever there is a
change in the application, to restart the application automatically, nodemon
module is used.
Install the nodemon module globally to system path
npm i -g nodemon
You can also install nodemon as a development-dependency
npm i -D nodemon
This local installation of nodemon can be run by calling it from within npm
script such as npm start or using npx nodemon.
Run the application using nodemon followed by application file name.
nodemon app.js

that can be run by using

"scripts": {
"start-dev": "node lib/server-development",
"start": "node lib/server-production"
}
}

"unit": "jest --config test/unit/jest.conf.js --coverage",
"test": "npm run unit",
"lint": "eslint --ext .js,.vue src test/unit",
"build": "node build/build.js"
}
