High-Level Observations:

   * Monolithic Control Loop: The entire control logic is within a single setInterval function. This makes it difficult to test, maintain,
     and debug.
   * Lack of Modularity: While the components (fan, heater, etc.) are in separate files, their control logic is tightly coupled within the
     main loop.
   * State Management: The controllerStatus object is a global-like object that's being updated from multiple places. This can lead to
     unpredictable behavior and makes it hard to track data flow.
   * No Error Handling: There's no explicit error handling within the control loop. If one of the component's process() methods throws an
     error, it could crash the entire application.

  Specific Suggestions:

   1. Refactor the Control Loop:
       * Break down the main setInterval callback into smaller, more manageable functions. For example, have separate functions for reading
         sensors, updating component states, and broadcasting the status.
       * Consider a more event-driven approach. Instead of a fixed-interval loop, have components emit events when their state changes, and
         have other components listen and react to those events. This would make the system more responsive and efficient.

   2. Improve State Management:
       * Instead of a single controllerStatus object, consider a more structured state management solution. This could be a simple state
         machine or a more advanced library like Redux (if you were using React on the frontend, which you are not).
       * Each component should manage its own internal state, and the main control loop should only be responsible for orchestrating the
         components and aggregating their data for broadcasting.

   3. Add Error Handling:
       * Wrap the code inside the setInterval callback in a try...catch block to prevent unhandled exceptions from crashing the
         application.
       * Implement a more robust logging strategy to capture and log errors.

   4. Improve Code Readability and Maintainability:
       * Add comments to explain the purpose of the different components and the control logic.
       * Use a consistent coding style and formatting. I see that eslint.config.js exists, which is great. Running a linter can help
         enforce this.

  Next Steps:

  I can start by refactoring the controlLoop.js to break down the monolithic setInterval into smaller, more testable functions. This will be
   the first step towards a more modular and maintainable design.

  Would you like me to proceed with this refactoring?

âœ¦ You're right, an event-driven approach is a great way to improve the design. It will make the system more modular, responsive, and easier
  to maintain.

  Here's my plan to refactor the application to be event-driven:

   1. Introduce an Event Emitter: I'll create a simple event emitter service using Node.js's built-in events module. This will act as a
      central message bus for the application.
2. Refactor Components to Emit Events: I'll modify the components (temperatureSensor, light, etc.) to emit events when their state changes. For example, the temperatureSensor will emit a temperatureChanged event whenever it reads a new temperature.
   3. Refactor Components to Listen for Events: Components that need to react to changes in other components will listen for the relevant
      events. For example, the heater and vent components will listen for the temperatureChanged event and adjust their state accordingly.
   4. Decouple the Control Loop: The main control loop will be simplified to just initialize the components and set up the initial event
      listeners. The fixed-interval setInterval will be removed, and the logic will be triggered by events.
