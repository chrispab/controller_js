# Gemini Project Configuration

This file provides project-specific instructions and context for Gemini.

## Gemini Added Memories
- the project is edited on a development system using vscode. The project files are accessed and saved in an nfs share from the target hardware, a raspberry pi.
- Gemini runs on the development sytem where vscode is used, it cannot run commands like `npm install` or start the application.
- the actual node program runs on a remote raspberry pi target system, so raspberry pi terminal commands must be run manually on the target via an SSH session.
